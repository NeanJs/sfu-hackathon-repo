Inspiration
The inspiration behind Leadger is to empower users to take effective action by identifying and supporting companies aligned with their personal values, while offering alternatives to companies whose stocks, deals, or political links contradict their beliefs. This project stems from the global necessity to act consciously amid ongoing conflicts and social issues. Additionally, Leadger aims to provide companies, governments, and analysts with valuable, ethically sourced information to help shape policies, financial strategies, and economic forecasting by gaining a deeper understanding of users' value systems. Leadger itself remains neutral, tailoring results based solely on each user’s unique profile.

What it does
Leadger helps users understand their social and political positions and purchasing behavior to identify companies they engage with that may not align with their values. It then finds local, sustainable, and viable alternatives that satisfy their needs equivalently. Beyond individual use, Leadger aggregates and analyzes data to generate anonymized consumer insights for companies, governments, analysts, financiers, and conglomerates. These insights reveal “unspoken opinions” and trends, enabling more reliable market condition forecasts.

How we built it
Our team applied Strategizer methodologies to develop Leadger’s business idea and feasibility study, focusing on the most effective value proposition. We used Fishbone diagram principles and MVP conceptualization, emphasizing social impact, economic potential, and alignment with UN Sustainable Development Goals. Prototype versions were iterated using the Gemini API (details pending), and we sought continuous feedback from volunteer stormhackers and mentors across business, technological, usability, and design dimensions.

Challenges we ran into
We faced limited benchmarking opportunities due to a lack of similar projects. Data scraping complexities and managing version control with shared Git repositories, alongside collaborative coding agents, were also significant hurdles. Additionally, fluctuating prioritization of feature values during development required ongoing adjustments.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We have successfully developed a functional prototype incorporating dynamic profiling and personalized company alignment features. Iterations based on community and mentor feedback strengthened usability and user experience. Our team’s multidisciplinary collaboration proved crucial in navigating complex ethical and technical considerations.

What we learned
We gained valuable insights into blending technology with social impact, particularly in balancing user privacy with data utility. The iterative prototyping process reinforced the importance of agile development and stakeholder engagement to refine value propositions. Understanding the nuances of ethical consumerism deepened our commitment to creating transparent, user-centered solutions.

What's next
We plan to validate Leadger’s business potential through expert consultations in data protection and digital law regarding data collection, storage, and monetization. We will continue testing the project’s scope as an agent of social change by empowering uncoordinated collaborative economic action. This enables people to pressure corporations and governments with their wallets, redistributing value to local businesses and sustainable alternatives.
